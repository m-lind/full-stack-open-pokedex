Python is the language of my choice. Tools for linting are for example Pylint that looks for errors and tries enforcing a coding standard, PyFlakes that does analyzing and error detecting, pycodestyle that checks that some of the style conventions in PEP 8 apply and Bandit which tries to find security issues. Tools for testing are for example PyUnit that is part of Python library and is flexible and fast because individual test cases can be run, Robot framework which is modular and has simple syntax and Pytest which caters to all needs with many plugins to choose from.

Because Python is an interpreted language, the build step not so much for compiling purposes but instead it is there for dependency management, code packaging, code optimization, automated testing and code quality checks. In case of Python the build tools can very often be integrated with testing or linting tools for automation purposes.
Specific tools for building are for example PlatformIO for embedded software building, PyBuilder which is simple to use build tool for Python and Scons which is especially good when complex build processes are used.

Other alternatives to setup CI than Jenkins or GitHub Actions include for example Azure DevOps and CircleCI.
Azure DevOps would probably be better for cloud-based environment since it’s fully managed service and in the cloud. Azure DevOps services offer high scalability and flexibility. Self-hosting comes into place if there is a need for control over the infrastructure. Also in cloud-based environment internet needs to be accessed at all times but it’s not the case in self-hosting environment.
 CicrcleCI has the same limitations as Azure DevOps as self-hosting environment, so for CircleCI would probably be better for cloud-based environment as well. Also getting started with cloud-based environment is quicker and less work setting up.
